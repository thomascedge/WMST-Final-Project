                            Presented on the left is what the average white male wears on a typical night in downtown Athens. Presented on the right is what a fellow classmate was wearing on the evening that he was denied from Hedges bar due to his shoes going against the bar’s outlined “dress code”. This is only one example of the many ways in which downtown Athens bars utilize oppression and racism as tools to keep minorities excluded from a fun, energetic environment that is supposed to be welcome to everyone. Constant oppression like this can also cause more severe damage on an individual and their identity. While bar owners make it seem like they are only denying someone based on their clothing, the fact of the matter is that they are denying people based on how they physically appear and their skin color. It is racist and makes people feel degraded, further solidifying their idea that they are worthless because of their physical appearance.

                        “White media executives have total control over the major media outlets and consciously reproduce upper class ideologies, which in turn subjugate racial minorities…” (Anderson and Collin,145)<br><br>
                        Media is a social institution because it helps order and structure behavior of individuals. It is an aspect in the representational realm that intersect race, class, and gender. Media is used as a reference and a learning course for hegemonic ideologies that reinforce stereotypes of race, class, and gender and encourage white supremacy through entertainment, advertisement and news outlets. It is a tool that maintains the status quo and reflect the views of society. It unfortunately uses stereotypes to attempt to relate to target audiences however in the process tear down self image just to get revenue.

                        White supremacy has always been a reoccurring event but recently has been happening a lot. Not too long ago it seem like every other week or month there was a black person (usually a black male) getting pulled over and being shot and or killed. Usually they are even pulled over for nothing. As you can see the picture on the left is a white person being pulled over and on the right you can see a black person getting pulled over and what happened to him. He was shot 4 time just for doing what the police officer asked him to do which was get his license also this was only less than 24 hours after the Alton sterling shooting death from a police officer which happens to be another black male.
